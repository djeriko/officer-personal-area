# Officer Personal Area

## Build the app from the command line

On Windows you need to specify paths to `JDK/bin` and `Android SDK Build Tools` in `PATH` Environment Variable.

### Build a debug APK

For immediate app testing and debugging, you can build a debug APK. The debug APK is signed with a debug key provided by the SDK tools and allows debugging through `adb`.
To build a debug APK, open a command line and navigate to the root directory of the repository. To initiate a debug build, invoke the `Debug`:

-   On Windows:

    ```Batchfile
    Debug.bat
    ```

-   On Mac or Linux: @todo #1 Create a bash script for building a debug APK

This creates an APK named `app-debug.apk` in `Build` directory. The file is already signed with the debug key and aligned with [zipalign](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/zipalign), so you can immediately install it on a device.

### Build a release APK

If you're ready to release and distribute the app, you must build a release APK that is signed with the private key. To initiate a release build, invoke the `Release`:

-   On Windows:

    ```Batchfile
    Release.bat
    ```

-   On Mac or Linux: @todo #1 Create a bash script for building a release APK

Provide the keystore password when you are asked to:

```Batchfile
Keystore password for signer #1:
```

On success, it creates an APK named `app-release-signed.apk` in `Build` directory. The app signed with the private key is ready for distribution, but you should first read more about how to [publish the app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/index.html) and review the [Google Play launch checklist](https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/launch-checklist.html).
